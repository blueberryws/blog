<h2>A Website Is An Asset</h2>
<p> As a small business owner, you've probably got 500 things to do before lunch today. Somewhere in your pile of "todos" is a sticky note that says, "build website?". If you've been at this a minute, it might say, "redo website". Either way, it's something that you glance at every couple of weeks, but you can't really figure out what to do with it. It's just so... vague. You've got prospects to follow up with, order to fill, clients to see, bills to pay. What does a website even do, anyway?</p>

<p> A Website Is An Asset</p>

<p>This is probably the most useful way to think about a website. It's as much of an asset as an oven is to a baker, or a skid-steer to a landscaper. Like most assets, it won't do much for your business unless it is properly leveraged.</p>

<p>When properly leveraged, an oven bakes cakes, and a skid-steer shapes the dirt. When properly leveraged, a website becomes an asset that <em>makes the phone ring</em>.</p>

<section id="goals">
<h2>#goals</h2>
<p>In order for a website to be successful, you have to have fairly well defined goals about what it is supposed to do. The website needs to fit into your overall business strategy. For most of our customers at Blueberry Web Services, a website's raison d'etre is to drive more business. In other words, the website exists to make the phone ring.</p>

<p>The problem with this goal is that it isn't actionable by itself. The "why" doesn't immediately suggest the "how". The broad strokes of "how" follow a predictable pattern (which I'll lay out in the next section), but the specifics are highly dependent on your overall business strategy. It involves answering questions like, "what is your current customer acquisition strategy?" and "what is your target demographic?"</p>

<p>If you don't have a well defined answer for, "how does my website fit into my overall business strategy?" that's okay! (You can check out <a href="TODO">this article</a> for help getting that written out). If you choose us to build your next website, we spend a significant chunk of time working with your to match the site to your strategy before we even start the design process. If you choose to build it yourself, reading that article on establishing a strategy can help you make sure that you get the site aligned with your larger business goals in a way that makes the phone ring.</p>

<small>Side Note: For some of our customers, the website exists to simplify their business processes. If that's the reason for your webiste, we still cover that during our design sessions, but the rest of this article will be less relevant to you directly.</small>

<h2>A Virtuous Cycle</h2>
<p>Once you have a well defined strategy, you'll need to decide how your website fits into all of this. For most of our customers, the high-level outline of the plan for your website usually follows this shape:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="">Drive Traffic To Your Site</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Convert Traffic Into Business</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Make "repeat customers"</a></li>
  <li><a href="">Analyze and Optimize</a></li>
</ol>

<p>The specific steps that you take to accomplish these goals depends largely on who your customers are, and how your website fits into your overall business strategy. If we develop the site for you, we will help you pick specific steps to accomplish each of these steps.</p>

<p>These four steps form a virtuous cycle that feeds into itself. You make a plan to drive traffic to your site, execute on that plan, make happy customers, gather data about what went well, and then tweak the plan to be more effective. Over time, your vision of your ideal customers gets clearer and clearer, and the plan leverage your website to reach that target audience becomes more and more refined. The phone starts ringing more and more often.</p>

<h2>An Asset That Makes The Phone Ring</h2>
<p>Lots of businesses have a website. Some of them even got lucky, and their website makes their phone ring, but for most businesses, their site is just an online flier that never really gets seen.</p>

<p>If we can get your website properly aligned to your business strategy, then it will become an asset that makes your phone ring.</p>
<p>If you take that asset, and work the virtuous cycle, then it becomes an asset that makes your phone ring even more.</p>
